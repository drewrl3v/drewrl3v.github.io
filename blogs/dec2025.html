  <h4>Planning To Leave</h4> <p> 
    
    
    I've spent the past four years at UCLA working toward a PhD in Statistics, 
    though most of my work centered on generative modeling and machine learning. 
    I'm grateful for the friends I made and for the support of my advisors.
   </p> <p> 

    However, that's not to say there weren't significant problems in my department: 
    rivalry between research groups, fights between co-authors, 
    constantly being asked to write grants, taking care of other professors duties, 
    and even engineering tools for other companies without credit or pay.

    Over time, this wore on my mental health, and I've reached the point where 
    continuing no longer feels feasible.

  </p> <p> I don't view my experience as universal, and I truly want my peers to thrive. 
    For me, I'm planning to leave this environment.
    The upside is that I can now explore the ideas I've been putting off, 
    pursue work that feels meaningful, and make space for creativity again. </p>
