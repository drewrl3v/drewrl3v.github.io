[An argument against puzzle problems](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Blog/puzzles_harmful.html)

|**My stance regarding puzzle problems:** Puzzle problems are a form of intellectual entertainment and nothing more.
Have fun!|

**September 2023:**
I flip a fair coin until I see two heads (HH) or until I see a heads followed by a tails (HT).
Should the number of expected flips until I see HH be less than, equal to, or larger than the expected 
number of flips until I see a HT?

**October 2023:**
I have 12 identical pieces of candy. In how many ways can I distribute the candies to 4 
different kids?

**November 2023:**
A man in a gallery is asked about a portrait depicting a man with an object obscuring his face.
He responds, 'Brothers and sisters I have none, but that man's father is my father's son.'

What is the object obscuring the face of the man in the portrait?

**December 2023:**
Take a circle and draw two chords at random on the circle. What's the probability that the two 
chords intersect?

**January 2024:**
What is the probability that three uniformly random points on a circle will be contained in some semicircle?

**February 2024:**
I have assigned two uniformly distributed random numbers from -1000 to 1000 on two slips of paper and turn them face down.

You are allowed to turn the first slip over and examine the value. If you believe it's the larger of the two values, you keep
the slip of paper. If not, you keep the second slip of paper. You win if you get the larger of the two values.

Is it possible to come up with a strategy that let's you win more than 50% of the time?
