# Some Algorithms

## About

1. This notebook is meant to be an incremental approach to algorithms similar to the style presented in Finite-Dimensional Linear Analysis, Ju. I. Glazman, I. M. & Ljubic. So, there is little to no explanation. Just the problems and their corresponding solutions. Though, I try to order the problems in the most natural order possible.

2. I emphasize and inductive approach early on, but merely use it as an initial guide and I will diverge from inductive reasoning when presented with problems where it's more intuitive to do so. 

3. I assume you have exposure to programming, but would like another resource for algorithms.

4. This notebook will go through a variety of problems from summing a list of numbers all the way to the Huffman Compression Algorithm.

5. There is a variety of problems from all over the place leetcode, Skiena, Goodrich, Cormen, Manber, ect. So it'll be a lot, but I hope it's enjoyable for you.

6. It's perfectly fine to look at the solutions, just make sure you understand them and attempt the problems on your own later. Also be sure to consult additional resources for different perspectives.

7. I don't have the best solutions or explanations out there. Make a copy of this notebook, and see if you can provide your style, your expansions and your insights.

## Warning: 

These problems are what I call puzzle problems, I make no claim about whether or not solving these puzzles actually leads to better knowledge of real-world algorithmic problems.

This should be treated as a form of intellectual entertainment. So be exceptionally cautious if you're going to use these problems as some sort of evaluation metric of a real-life human being.

Also, heuristics are great! We will use them in this notebook. But when making a claim such as: 'people who know how to do X under a time constraint means that they know Y and are Z ect.', proceed
with caution. Even if it's obvious, even if it's simple, even if you know your heuristic is true; keep in mind that at best what you have here is a very strong hypothesis that needs very strong
evidence to back your claim. To outright ignore testing your suspicion is to be unscientific about your reasoning.
