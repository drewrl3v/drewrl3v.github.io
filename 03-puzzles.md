**September 2023:**

I flip a fair coin until I see two heads (HH) or until I see a heads followed by a tails (HT).
Should the number of expected flips until I see HH be less than, equal to, or larger than the expected 
number of flips until I see a HT?

**October 2023:**

I have 12 identical pieces of candy. In how many ways can I distribute the candies to 4 
different kids?
