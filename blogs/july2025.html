    <h4>On the Bottom of it:</h4>
  
    <p>
      There is common phrase (usually with positive intent) that someone is "on top of it". 
      Meaning they are keeping pace, always seems to know the right moves, ect.
    </p>
    <p>
      However for me (your milage may vary) sometimes it's better to be underneath it all.
      At the root, the cause, the structure. That's where the invariants live. 
      That's where compression happens. 
      Don Knuth called this "bottom up" thinking: i.e. finding the foundation before building the tower.
    </p>

      I'd rather understand one (ideally simple) thing deeply than balance a thousand shallow ones. 
      That way, when the stack collapses, I still know what it was built on.

      The advancements of AI have been truly exciting these past few years. However I'm genuinely concerned 
      that many people are feeling enticed to apply these models to their work when in reality they can 
      actually achieve their goals with significantly simpler approaches. Also, sometimes our excitment leads 
      to overconfidence and memory loss. I remember as a kid seeing some news that in 2 years there will be 
      self-driving cars. And it feels like for me that it's been 2 years for 15 years.

      To be fair, self-driving cars are getting much better. But my point being all the techniques that existed 
      "2 years" ago are likely obsolete because none of them were foundational. And I have a feeling we still 
      haven't found the foundation otherwise there would be no work to be done in self-driving cars.
