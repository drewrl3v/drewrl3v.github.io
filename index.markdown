# Andrew Lizarraga

PhD Student in Statistics | Staff Researcher at UCLA's Brain Mapping Center

I'm a first year PhD student at UCLA's Department of Statistics. 
Prior to this I was a staff researcher at UCLA's Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain Mapping Center.
Some of my current research interests are:

* Deep Learning and applications to high-dimensional signals and images.
* Inplicit and prior geometric information encoding in neural networks.
* Graph neural networks.
