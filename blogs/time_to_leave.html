<h4>
Time To Leave:
</h4>

I don't feel very welcomed in the world. Even to my friends and loved ones I feel 
like I'm a stranger. To be honest, I don't think this situation is too terrible if 
it weren't for the fact that I have responsibilities and obligations to loved ones 
because of course you do. 

But constantly it feels like for some reason I'm in debt to them. Whatever I do is 
never good enough and I find myself tip-toeing in a mine field. I can't afford errors 
because them I owe friends and loveds ones:

1. The gift I gave wasn't the right one.
2. Showed up a little too early.
3. Showed up a little too late.
4. Talked too much.
5. Didn't talk enough.

These are of course very minor, but over the course of 29 years they accumulate. 
Then the more majors ones really feel devistating. When I push back on work, people 
just try to still shove more work on me. They try and treat it as an opportunity.

It can be something simple along the lines of:
    ?: "Do you want ___ to eat."
    ME: "No thanks!"
    ?: "Here you go, I know you want it"
    ME: "I didn't know I wanted this."

Or to something more serious:
    ?: "You're an expert in ___. I told ___ that you are the person who can solve there problem."
    ME: "I appreciate the offer, but my hands are tied."
    ?: "This is a great opportunity and you really are an expert in this topic. Please, we can hop
        on a call right now about this."

I'm not happy about this. I don't like that people treat me as a tool when it's convenient for
whatever they have in their head. I really want this to stop and to just focus on what I'm 
interested in. 

I feel like I haven't lived yet. I've done so much work for others, that I never do anything 
for myself. I believe this is in part because I've been concerned with getting a job and that 
usually means you work for someone or some company as a whole. So I need to do and practice 
things that make me desirable to them. But this has turned into me being used al the time. 
Even by friends and loved ones (even if it's not their intentions).

I think the reality is that I need to leave. I need to focus on the things I actually care about.
