[An argument against puzzle problems](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Blog/puzzles_harmful.html)

|**My stance regarding puzzle problems:**
Puzzle problems are a form of intellectual entertainment and nothing more. Have fun!|

**September 2023:**
I flip a fair coin until I see two heads (HH) or until I see a heads followed by a tails (HT).
Should the number of expected flips until I see HH be less than, equal to, or larger than the expected 
number of flips until I see a HT?

**October 2023:**
I have 12 identical pieces of candy. In how many ways can I distribute the candies to 4 
different kids?

**November 2023:**
A man in a gallery is asked about a portrait depicting a man with an object obscuring his face.
He responds, 'Brothers and sisters I have none, but that man's father is my father's son.'

What is the object obscuring the face of the man in the portrait?
