|PhD Student in Statistics | Staff Researcher at UCLA's Brain Mapping Center |

I'm a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at UCLA, where I'm currently
co-advised by Professors [Ying Nian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/) and [Shantanu H. Joshi](http://sjoshi.bmap.ucla.edu/). 
I perform joint work primarily in the intersection of Deep Learning and Neuroscience. Some high-level research interests of 
mine are:

* Representation Learning
* Generative Modeling
* Quantized Models
* Inference
