<h4>
Simple Enough:
</h4>

We don't allow ourselves to participate in academic simplicities.
For example one of my earliest papers was about registering white matter streamlines in the brain.
The problem is more or less solved by finding an affine transformation between one bundle to another.
<p></p>
So the problem as stated is fairly straight forward: Find an affine registration between streamlines.
<p></p>
Since the procedure is simple the result is also simple to analyze. We analyze streamlines between groups 
of patients to understand them better in a statistical sense.
<p></p>
However you can never publish this in this day an age, because it's not novel. Even if you develop a better 
algorithm for the affine registration (I believe I have this by the way), it's not novel. It doesn't solve 
a more sophisticated problem. But the thing is, I really don't think there are many other people who are 
actually going to do this. Not because they are incapable, but they aren't interested in this. But I am. 
Because it's simple. But my obligations as a researcher is not this, despite how much I think it's important.
<p></p>
Mind you that this is all purely psychological. I can always take the time to work on this. But I can't get 
a job with this; it takes time away from the research I should be focusing on.
<p></p>
To be honest, I don't even think this would be an issue for me to write about if it weren't for the fact 
that other people really expect me to focus on super tough problems: Using DDPMs to model the conditional 
relationship between the redshift of galaxies and their physical characteristics or using VQ-VAEs to tokenize 
medical data, ect. But I really wonder if this complicated machinery will actually be useful in a real medical 
context.
<p></p>
People want to know if they have cancer because they want to know if they can be treated. To be cured. 
You would feel rather terrible if I told you that we can predict you will develop a tumor in your brain, but 
we don't actually know how to prevent it. This is not a solution. And realistically the solution might be more 
in the form of a drug. But the thing with testing drugs is that you want to confirm the efficacy and safety of a 
new drug using as few clinical trials as possible. You don't have billions of data points to work with and you 
need to make a messy and complicated decision. But experimental design (while difficult) is seen as too simple 
from many. It's not as fancy as: "We used RL to search and construct proteins for novel drugs" or 
"Based on a single X-Ray we can predict if you'll have bone cancer in the future". This isn't to say that these 
are not good causes, but I think we focus on them too much. Because what' important is really curing these diseases. 
But that's an inferential statistics task. That's too simple. Not a hot field of study.

RL can discover new moves in Chess because of world model being combinatorial, bounded, finite.
However RL cannot discover anything new in LLM's because of the same reasons Approximate dynamic 
programming cannot.

Autoregressive models are limited in that they can only solve some L in P with P compute.
But not all P.
